## 📝 Description 
The task for this project is to simply apply what we've learned in JavaScript by creating a simple calculator.
My initial approach was to make it as interactive as possible, however, due to time constraints, I focused more on functionality and just discarded my original plan of making a gaming mode. <br>

Gladly, the outcome still looks great and I was able to achieve a realistic look on its design. Function-wise, it can handle complex problems or expressions and is also able to distinguish different errors. There are also a lot of factors I have to consider when creating it such as if the input or the answer is too long, how to avoid possible issues caused by using the evaluate function, the relevance of other elements I implemented in the project, and many more.
